# Etch-A-Scetch, now "Pixelize"

This is my The Odin Project version of the Etch A Sketch.

Was able to get the overall look and grid choosing, as well as buttons.
Initially, I was stumped at parts of this on how to get the mouse to "draw" on the grid.  So I did some googling and found a guy on Youtube that I followed along with:

Didn't want to just "copy" the entire thing so I've made alterations as I went along.  At the end of it I wasn't satisfied so I've taken the liberty to learn functions
further and added a few of my own things:

--changed from Etch-A-Sketch to a pixel art maker, mouseover in javascript draws continiously, yet mousedown doesn't... 

--Added a proper grid layout.

--Added an erase button for individual pixels.

--Added a wide arrange of colors.
  This part was difficult, as I tried to get a color picker as the main choice for the cases in my switch, but I think cases pull functions, rgba... I'm sure there is a way
  but I've spent days on this and resorted to just making individual cases for every color, including black and white.
  
--Additional CSS flair, top button highlights, unique title font, and color swatches that float up when mouse is over them.
  

What I would like to do next

*I'd like to go back to this and add some things, like a way to download your art.  The code is there, but it's not working as intended.

--Downloading your finished art (code needs fixing).

--A proper way to draw pixels as you drag the mouse while clicked, instead of one click at a time

--a fill tool maybe?

--bigger brush options?
